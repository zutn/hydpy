test_v2

This simple test model is thought for testing numerical integration
strategies.  It can be seen from two perspectives.  On the one hand it
implements a simple discontinous equation, bringing numerical
integration algorithms into trouble.  On the other hand it describes a
simple storage with a loss that is constant over time, as long as some
storage content is left.  The loss rate

Q

 and the initial storage content

S

 can be set as required.

class hydpy.models.test_v2.Model

   Bases:

   The following methods define the relevant components of a system of
   ODE equations (e.g. direct runoff):
      calc_q_v2() Calculate the actual storage loss.

   The following methods define the complete equations of an ODE
   system (e.g. change in storage of *fast water* due to  effective
   precipitation and direct runoff):
      calc_s_v1() Calculate the actual storage content.
