HydPy-L (LARSIM)

HydPy implements a close emulation of the central routines of the
LARSIM model, which is applied by many forecasting centres in Germany
and some neighbouring countries.  The version 1 application models of
HydPy-L agree very well with a LARSIM configuration called LARSIM-ME
(Middle Europe), being used by the German Federal Institute of Germany
(BfG) for calculating hydroclimatic scenarios for large river basins
(see e.g. the

KLIWAS

 project).  HydPy-L is partly based on the original publication on
LARSIM (

BREMICKER (2000)

), the summary of the theory and the range of applications of LARSIM,
which is continuously updated by the LARSIM development community (

LARSIM-Entwicklergemeinschaft

), the LARSIM online documentation (

LARSIM Online-Hilfe

), and some useful hints of the colleagues of the LUBW (Landesanstalt
für Umwelt, Messungen und Naturschutz Baden-Württemberg) and the
HYDRON GmbH.  Some other parts of HydPy-L have been programmed more
independently and were incorporated into the original LARSIM
implementation later.

HydPy-L is divided into three base models, which can be used to
compile different application models:


So far the following application models are compiled:


All these application models are stand-alone models, which can be
combined freely with other models implemented in HydPy.

For reason of consistency with the original LARSIM implementation, the
names of all parameter and sequence classes are German terms and
abbreviations. However, the documentation on each parameter or
sequence contains an English translation.
