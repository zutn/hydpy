test_v1

This simple test model is thought for testing numerical integration
strategies.  It can be seen from two perspectives.  On the one hand it
implements the Dahlquist test equation (on the real axis only), which
is related to stiff initial value problems.  On the other hand it
describes a simple storage with a linear loss term and without any
input.  The loss rate

Q

 and the initial storage content

S

 can be set as required.

   The following methods define the relevant components of a system of
   ODE equations (e.g. direct runoff):
      calc_q_v1() Calculate the actual storage loss.

   The following methods define the complete equations of an ODE
   system (e.g. change in storage of *fast water* due to  effective
   precipitation and direct runoff):
      calc_s_v1() Calculate the actual storage content.
