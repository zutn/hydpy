hbranch_v1

class hydpy.models.hbranch_v1.Model

   Bases:

   hydpy.models.hbranch.hbranch_model.Model

   The HBV96 version of HydPy-H-Stream (hbranch_v1).

   The following "run methods" are called each simulation step run in
   the given sequence:
      calc_outputs_v1() Performs the actual interpolation or
      extrapolation.

   The following "inlet update methods" are called in the given
   sequence immediately  before solving the differential equations of
   the respective model:
      pick_input_v1() Updates Input based on Total.

   The following "outlet update methods" are called in the given
   sequence immediately  after solving the differential equations of
   the respective model:
      pass_outputs_v1() Updates Branched based on Outputs.

class hydpy.models.hbranch_v1.ControlParameters(pars, cls_fastaccess=None, cymodel=None)

   Bases:

   hydpy.core.parametertools.SubParameters

   Bases:

   hydpy.core.parametertools.SubParameters

   Derived parameters of hbranch_v1, indirectly defined by the user.

   The following parameter classes are selected:
      NmbBranches Number of branches [-].

      NmbPoints Number of supporting points for linear interpolation
      [-].

      Outputs Branched outputs [e.g. m³/s].

class hydpy.models.hbranch_v1.InletSequences(seqs, cls_fastaccess=None, cymodel=None)

   Bases:

   hydpy.core.sequencetools.LinkSequences

   Upstream link sequences of hbranch_v1.

   The following sequence classes are selected:
      Total Total input [e.g. m³/s].

class hydpy.models.hbranch_v1.OutletSequences(seqs, cls_fastaccess=None, cymodel=None)

   Bases:

   hydpy.core.sequencetools.LinkSequences
