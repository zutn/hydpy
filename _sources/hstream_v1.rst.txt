hstream_v1

class hydpy.models.hstream_v1.Model

   Bases:

   hydpy.core.modeltools.Model

   The HBV96 version of HydPy-H-Stream (hstream_v1).

   The following "run methods" are called each simulation step run in
   the given sequence:
      calc_qjoints_v1() Apply the routing equation.

   The following "inlet update methods" are called in the given
   sequence immediately  before solving the differential equations of
   the respective model:
      pick_q_v1() Assign the actual value of the inlet sequence to the
      upper joint of the subreach upstream.

   The following "outlet update methods" are called in the given
   sequence immediately  after solving the differential equations of
   the respective model:
      pass_q_v1() Assing the actual value of the lower joint of of the
      subreach downstream to the outlet sequence.
