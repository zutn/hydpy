Installation Instructions
=========================

Selecting a Python distribution
--------------------------------

Using :ref:`HydPy` requires installing Python first.  If you are new to
Python, we recommend installing a convenient Python distribution like
`Anaconda`_, already containing many scientific and mathematical tools.
Eventually, you might need to install additional libraries.  For
example, if you do not use pre-compiled binaries (see the next section),
you might have to install the `coverage`_ site-package manually. With
Anaconda on your system, type in your command line interface::

    conda install coverage

The `conda`_ installer is very convenient but does not support all packages
available through the `Python Package Index`_.  If conda does nor support
the required package (or if conda is not on your system), you can
use `pip`_, which is in most cases as convenient as conda::

    pip install coverage

We recommend working with Python 3.6, which is currently
the latest stable version of Python.  Nevertheless, HydPy also supports
Python 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5. Note that Python 2.7 is quite old and
will possibly be not further developed much longer.  The only reason
we still support it is to allow users to combine :ref:`HydPy` with
older Python packages.

Selecting a HydPy version
-------------------------

If you want to contribute to the development of  :ref:`HydPy` or implement
own models, please see the :ref:`development` section.  If you want to
apply :ref:`HydPy` only, you should start with a stable version available
under `releases`_.

Probably, you are interested in using the latest version of :ref:`HydPy`,
which is the one with the highest version number.  HydPy's version numbers
consist of three separate numbers. In "X.Y.Z.", "X" is the major number.
There can be important differences between :ref:`HydPy` versions with
different major numbers, possibly resulting in some incompatibility issues
with interfacing systems.  "Y" is the minor revision number, indicating
some improvements, but no potentially problematic changes, e.g. the
implementation of additional models.  "Z" is the revision number,
indicating some necessary corrections of the framework or its implemented
models.  In any case, you should make sure to select the highest revision
number available, meaning you should prefer using "X.Y.1" over "X.Y.0".

Each release is available in different compressed archives,
corresponding to different environments.  Currently, we distribute
pre-compiled binaries for Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 on 64-bit Windows
only.  These are most easy to use.  Download and unpack them in
your site-packages directory.  The site-packages directory is the place
to store additional Python libraries.  Usually, each installed
Python distribution contains a "Lib" folder, which again contains the
"site-packages" folder.  So, finally, the resulting pathname should be
something like "C:\\Python36\\Lib\\site-packages\\hydpy".

For all other operating systems and Python versions, you have to build
binaries yourself.  Principally, this should be simple, but Windows users
might need to install the suitable compiler first (see below).  Download
and uncompressed the `source code` archive in an arbitrary folder and open
the command line interface within the uncompressed `hydpy` folder.
Then write::

    python setup.py install

This command starts copying all available files to your site-packages folder
and generating the necessary system dependent binary files.  Additionally,
the testing system of :ref:`HydPy` is triggered. If everything works well,
you finally get the message::

    test_everything.py resulted in 0 failing unit test suites,
    0 failing doctest suites in Python mode and 0 failing doctest
    suites in Cython mode.

If a test suit fails, you get an additional warning message.  Then see
the more detailed test report above for additional information.
If there seems to be a severe problem, check if it is a known (and
possibly solved) `issue`_, already.  If not, please raise a new one.


Selecting a C Compiler
----------------------

You only need to care about selecting a C compiler, if no pre-compiled
binaries are available for your system or if you want to implement
new models into the :ref:`HydPy` framework.  Also, Linux users should
have no trouble, as the `GNU Compiler Collection`_ is ready for
use on standard Linux distributions.  Unfortunately, Windows does not
include compilers by default.  Search `Windows Compilers page`_ on how
to select and install the correct compiler.

After installing the required compiler successfully on Windows, you
might eventually have to deal with the **unable to find vcvarsall.bat**
problem.  `vcvarsall` is a batch file Python needs to control the installed
Visual Studio compiler.  Find this file on your system and set a new
system variable pointing to its path.  A quick search on the internet
should provide you with the required information.
